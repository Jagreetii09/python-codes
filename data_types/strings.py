# String variable names in Python start with a letter followed by
# combination of letters, digits or underscore (no white spaces).
# String literals are enclosed in single '...' or double "..." quotes.
# Strings can be indexed, with the first character having index 0.
# Indices may also be negative, to start counting from the right  with -1.
# Python strings cannot be changed â€” they are immutable. Therefore,
# assigning to an indexed position in the string results in an error.
