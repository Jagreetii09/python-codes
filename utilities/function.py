# The keyword def introduces a function definition. It must be followed
# by the function name and the parenthesized list of formal parameters.
# The statements that form the body of the function start at the next line,
# and must be indented. Variables in a function are local to that function.
#
# The first statement of the function body can optionally be a string literal
# enclosed in triple quotes ''' ... '''; this string literal is the 
# functionâ€™s documentation string, or docstring.
